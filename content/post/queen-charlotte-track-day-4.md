The sky started to light up before 5:00 am. It was delightful to wake up among melodious bird twittering. After treading mostly in wind and rain for three days, finally we hit a perfect sunny day and got to enjoy multiple stunningly scenic views along the trail. It was an easy hike out. At the end of  trail, we reunited with hikers that we had met and greeted during our 4 day trip along the trail. After a short wait at the dock, we took the same ferry back to where we started at the harbor in Picton.
