Before this trip, we learnt online that both canyons are similar in form and only in Upper Antelope Canyon light beams are visible at specific hours during the day. We are not big fans of photos of light beams and the tour to Lower Antelope Canyon is cheaper and less busy, we booked it with Ken's Tour ($27/person for the tour plus $8/person as parking fee).

Our tour guide was a 26-year old Navajo guy, who not only showed us the special corners in the canyon, but also introduced some history about their homeland. From him, we got to know that Page is a relatively new town founded in the 50s of last century at first as the campground for those who worked in the Glen Canyon Dam project. The word "antelope" in the canyon's name actually refers to  pronghorns due to their similar looking and there is no antelope existing in American continent. Tours to Antelope Canyons used to be self-guided and without the stable staircases along the way until in 1997 a group of 12 people was trapped in the slot by the sandy flood and the only survivor was a tour guide who was familiar with the local geography. Nowadays during the monsoon season (summer and early fall) the operators sometimes still have to cancel the tours for safety reason, problem that we don't have to worry about in winter. In the 1-hour underground tour, we witnessed a unique geographic miracle with our own eyes, enchanted by the infinite sleek waves carved by nature out of the pink sandstone as if gazing at some surreal paintings.

After the tour, we snacked and decided to explore Waterholes Canyon Trail, which is located in the Navajo Nation Land. Looking down at the edge of the cliffs, Waterholes Canyon seems like a terrifyingly huge and deep crack in the ground (Penguin said she did feel dizzy looking down the bottom of the canyon and hesitated about descending it), but actually going down to its bottom wasn't as hard as it seemed. The canyon is wider and deeper than Lower Antelope Canyon and sections of the sandstones show similar pinky curves. After reaching a point where there was a dramatic descending in the level of the ground with remains of torn down stairs aside, we determined it was time to hike back up to the ground. Though Waterholes Canyon doesn't look as pinky and dreamy as Antelope Canyons, but it was great that we could hang out there as long as we wanted!
