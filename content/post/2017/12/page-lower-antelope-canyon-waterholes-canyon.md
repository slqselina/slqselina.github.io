Before this trip, we learnt online that both canyons are similar in form and only in Upper Antelope Canyon light beams are visible at specific hours during the day. We are not big fans of photos of light beams and the tour to Lower Antelope Canyon is cheaper and less busy, we booked it with the only operator of it: Ken's Tour. Our tour guide was a 26-year old Navajo guy, who not only showed us the special corners in the canyon, but also introduced some history about their homeland. From him, we got to know that Page is a relatively new town founded in the 50s of last century at first as the campground for those who worked in the Glen Canyon Dam project. The word "antelope" in the canyon's name actually refers to  pronghorns due to their similar looking and there is no antelope existing in American continent. Tours to Antelope Canyons used to be self-guided and without the stable staircases along the way until in 1997 a group of 12 people was trapped in the slot by the sandy flood and the only survivor was a tour guide who was familiar with the local geography. Nowadays during the monsoon season (summer and early fall) the operators sometimes still have to cancel the tours for safety reason, problem that we don't have to worry about in winter. In the 1-hour tour, we stepped down deep under the ground and witnessed an unique geographic miracle with our own eyes, amazed by the infinite sleek waves of reddish rocks as if gazing at surreal paintings.
