Trip Log:

* 09:45am - Start out from Wire Pass Trailhead parking lot
* 10:35am - Reach the junction with Paria Canyon
* 12:06am - Here comes the tricky part of the trail: a pile of huge rocks kind of block the canyon, but getting through it is possible.
* 12:59pm - Stop and take a break.
* 01:24pm - Start to hike back
* 03:19am - Take an unusual long break (15~20 minutes) because of exchanging information with the only hiker we met on the trail.
* 04:20pm - back to the parking lot
