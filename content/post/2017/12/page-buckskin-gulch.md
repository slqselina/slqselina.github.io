If we see Lower Antelope Canyon as a lovely princess dressed all in pink, then Buckskin Gulch is a mysterious witch whose appearance capriciously varies between dark and bright, solitary and passionate, ugly and magnificent.

From Page to Wire Pass Trailhead is a 1-hour drive. We spent the last 25 minutes carefully moving on a gritty dirt road and were surprised by a naughty deer who crossed the road just in front of our car! "Hey watch out, buddy!" Maybe he did it on purpose to show off his great agility.

Wire Pass Trailhead is also the starting point of the famous Coyote Buttes (or the "Wave"). Getting to Coyote Buttes requires some luck: everyday only 20 permits are issued, 10 online and 10 on site. Since our stay was quite limited this time, we didn't bother to gamble for it (will try it next time) and directly headed to Buckskin Gulch after completing the self-registration and payment at the parking lot.

After walking 1-ish miles on an open wash, we started to entering the gulch and the trail gradually became gritty narrow, but that's when the magic started. The giant cliffs are in all kinds of odd shapes. Some look like piles of construction materials randomly dumped by the Creator from the sky, some appear like exquisite artworks of abstract expressionism and cubism, glowing in red, orange, pink, grey or dark blue depending on the angle of the sunshine. A section of the gulch was shady and cold enough to produce some ice cones hanging at the edge of the cliffs.

We passed 2 or 3 big natural caves on our way, which would have been converted into shrines for a huge Buddha statue if the location were in Thailand or China.

The cracked dry ground kind of explains the over-time formation of the stones and cliffs we saw in the gulch.

According to some online information, there would be water sources after 17 miles, but unfortunately we didn't have time to reach that point. This trail would make a challenging but fun 4-day backpacking trip if we had plenty of time and were well equipped. Maybe in the future ...
