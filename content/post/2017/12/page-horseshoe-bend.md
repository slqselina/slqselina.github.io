From Oro Valley, North Tucson to Page is a 6-or-7-hour long drive. From Hwy 10 Phoenix emanates an familiar air that reminded us of San Diego, palm trees, big buildings, heavy traffic ... After leaving the Sonoran Desert, the exotic saguaros totally give way to short bushes. To our surprise, the region around Flagstaff is covered with forests of pine tree, contracting the majority landscapes of bleak deserts. But after that, the scenery switches back to arid desertic lands, with less and less vegetation and more and more rocky mountains, sometimes white, sometimes pinky. During the last 1 hour towards Page, we had problems in finding a bathroom, because our cellphones showed zero signal and outside the window showed poor traces of modern civilization.

Finally, here we were in Page, a small town within Navajo Nation Reservation on the Arizona border with Utah, always teeming with tourists from all over the world in high season for its dreamy colorful canyons. However, visiting it in winter turned our a good idea to us, since we are already kind of used to the freezing temperatures in Tahoe region. Paying an economic price, we had not expected to get a room with beautiful view in Best Western View of Lake Powell Hotel, but we did! After checking in and taking a nap, we decided to dedicate the rest of the afternoon to must-see Horseshoe Bend, only 4.8 miles away from the hotel. The entrance and the trail to the lookout of the bend was busy, but still far from crowded as another benefit of traveling in low season. It is a less than 1 mile easy walk from the parking lot to the cliff edge over Horseshoe Bend. Because of the projection of shadow in the canyon, sunset time is not ideal for shooting the bend, but in turn the cliffs above the bend is endowed with a flaming bright orange color which combined with the blue sky as the background provides exotic-tuned pictures. After the sun is set though it gets more dark, it is actually better timing for taking pictures of the bend because the lighting in the canyon turs even.

I understand that due to the special and remote location of Page, our AT&T shows no service signal in the town, nor the wifi in the hotel is satisfactory, but at the same time there are a full-sized Walmart and a Safeway right by the hotel area. At least we don't have to worry about where to get water and snacks for tomorrow's tour and hikes, great.
