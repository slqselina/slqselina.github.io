From Oro Valley, North Tucson to Page is a 6-or-7-hour long drive. From Hwy 10 Phoenix emanates a familiar air that reminded us of San Diego: palm trees, big buildings, 5 lane merging freeways and heavy traffic...

After leaving the Sonoran Desert, the exotic saguaros give way to short bushes. To our surprise, the region around Flagstaff is covered with forests of pine tree contrasting with the earlier landscapes of bleak deserts. After Flagstaff, the scenery switches back to arid, desert lands with less and less vegetation and more and more rocky mountains: sometimes white, sometimes pink.

Finally, we were in Page: a small town within the Navajo Nation Reservation on the northern Arizona border with Utah. It is usually teeming with tourists from all over the world during the high season who come to see the dreamy, colorful canyons. However, visiting in winter turned out well for us. Since we are already acclimated to the freezing temperatures in Tahoe region, the averages of 40-50F were comfortable to us.

Having booked the cheapest available room, we did not expect to get a room with beautiful view of Lake Powell but we did! After checking in and taking a nap, we decided to dedicate the rest of the afternoon to the must-see Horseshoe Bend, only 4.8 miles away from the hotel. The trail to the lookout of the bend was busy and it is a 1 mile easy walk from the parking lot to the cliff's edge overlooking Horseshoe Bend. Because of the projection of shadow in the canyon, sunset time is not ideal for photographing the bend. But the cliffs above the bend is endowed with a flaming bright orange color which combined with the blue sky as the background provided exotic-tuned pictures. After the sun is set though it gets more dark, it is actually better timing for taking pictures of the bend because the lighting in the canyon turs even.

I understand that due to the special and remote location of Page, our AT&T shows no service signal in the town, nor the wifi in the hotel is satisfactory, but at the same time there are a full-sized Walmart and a Safeway right by the hotel area. At least we don't have to worry about where to get water and snacks for tomorrow's tour and hikes, great.
