Now we start to understand why Utah and Arizona are a photographer's dream. It is a land of contrasts and wonders. Even without a destination, driving on the road is like visiting a gallery, where the most audacious sculptures and carvings are being displayed.

But today we did have an destination: Spencer Trail, located within [Glen Canyon National Recreation Area](https://www.nps.gov/glca/index.htm) (entrance fee required). At the trailhead there are some historic houses and an introduction about the founding of Lee's Ferry.

This 4.4 mile out-and-back trail is categorized as _difficult_ on the [official website](https://www.nps.gov/glca/planyourvisit/day-hikes.htm). It is not hard to imagine how tough it would be during summer because the trail is fully exposed to the sun. As we embarked on the trail during winter, we actually appreciated the warmth from the sun as the temperature was low.

The trail provides a stunning view of the meandering Colorado River with the Vermillion Canyon walls as background.

But don't get too distracted by the view, because sections of the trail are narrow, steep and even slippery!

At the end of the trail is a vast plateau formed with Kayenta and Navajo sandstone.

We walked to the edge of the cliffs and sat down to snack while enjoying the canyon and river view.

There is a sign close to the start/end of Spencer Trail.

Trying to make a full use of the rest of the day, after finishing Spencer Trail, we drove right to the nearby trailhead of Cathedral Wash, which is divided into Upper and Lower sections. We only had enough time to hike the latter one, which ends at the bank of Colorado River.

Contrast to Spencer Trail which is fully exposed to the sun, the trail through Lower Cathedral Wash is mostly in the shade due to its special geological composition, which resembles cracked puff pastries. We were tiny ants who were marching along the open cracks in the pastries and climbing down numerous puff layers until reaching the bottom.

It was fun to explore the extremely quiet labyrinth-like wash in the daytime, kicking tumbleweeds like balls or shouting to experiment the echo.

But we wouldn't choose to be there at night. With the afternoon sunshine fading, it looked more and more like a perfect setting for horror movies.

Luckily we did make our way out before it was totally dark! It took us less than 2 hours out and back.
