Now we start to understand why Utah and Arizona are some photographers' preference. It is a land of contrasts and wonders. Even without any destination, driving on the road is like visiting a gallery, where the most audacious sculptures and carvings are being displayed.

<p>
But today we did have an destination: Spencer Trail, located within [Glen Canyon National Recreation Area](https://www.nps.gov/glca/index.htm) (entrance fee required). At the trailhead there are some historic houses and introduction about how Lee's Ferry was founded.

<p>
This 4.4-mile out-and-back trail is categorized difficult on the [official website](https://www.nps.gov/glca/planyourvisit/day-hikes.htm) and it is not hard to imagine how tough it will be in summer, because the whole trail is fully exposed, besides being rocky and gritty. But in winter, not so much. We actually appreciated the warmth from the sun when the temperature was low.

The trail provides a stunning view of the meandering Colorado River with the far back Vermillion Canyon as background.

<p>
But don't get too distracted by the view, because sections of the trail are narrow and steep, and even slippery!

At the end of the trail is a vast plateau formed with Kayenta and Navajo sandstone.

We walked to the edge of the cliffs and sat down to snack while enjoying the canyon and river view.
