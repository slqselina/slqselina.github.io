Hidden Beach Trail is a ramification of the Klamath Section of the Coastal Trail. It's an only 1 mile out-and-back easy walk and makes for a nice option if you only aim at chilling out and enjoying wonderful Northern California coastal views in a late afternoon as we did.

Comparing the dry sandy beaches in Southern California, beaches accompanied with verdant green cliffs look somehow alien but very appealing to us.

The trail was mostly narrow and level.

On our way to the beach, we met a couple of people on their way back and thus were joking that Hidden Beach didn't seem really hidden.

When we reached Hidden Beach without too much effort, we were lucky to have it for our own. No one was there except us! Now it did look like a hidden paradise.

Sunshine, ocean, warm breeze ... All this made napping irresistible.
