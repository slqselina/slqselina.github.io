Hidden Beach Trail is a part of the Klamath Section of the Coastal Trail. It's an only 1 mile out-and-back easy walk and makes for a nice option if you only want to chill out and enjoy those wonderful Northern California coastal views in the late afternoon as we did.

When compared to the dry sandy beaches in Southern California, beaches with verdant green cliffs look somehow alien but very appealing to us.

The trail was mostly narrow and level.

On our way to the beach, we met a couple of people on their way back and thus were joking that Hidden Beach didn't seem really _hidden_.

With little we reached Hidden Beach. We were lucky to have it to ourselves. No one was there except us! Now it did look like a hidden paradise.

Sunshine, ocean, warm breeze ... All this made napping irresistible.

Penguin tried to seize a few more precious moments of the nice beach and ocean view before heading back.
