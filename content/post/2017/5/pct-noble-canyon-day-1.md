 This was our first day and a short but very exposed ascent from Lake Morena to Fred Canyon. It was our first day so we didn't know quite what to expect. The first few miles were level. We went under Interstate 8 Freeway and started climbing. The trail was hot and we stopped frequently to rehydrate. We could have gone a bit farther but Penguin was really enamored by the campsite next to the stream in Fred Canyon so we stopped there around 2pm. After setting up our little REI tent, we laid around snacking on trail mix.
