We read somewhere that it would take 3 hours to do Royâ€™s Peak Track and were looking forward to a leisurely hike followed by sitting around eating ice cream at Lake Wanaka. But once at the trailhead and looking up at the towering Mt. Roy, we immediately realized we must have gotten it wrong! _3 hour was for one-way_.

Along the steep ascending trail was rewarding breath-taking panoramas of the blue lake, the scattered islands in it and the snow-capped mountains around it. So glad that we could rely on the rustic hand-carved wooden hiking poles that we had purchased during our [Queen Charlotte Track]({{< ref "post/2015/12/queen-charlotte-track-day-1.md" >}}) and the flocks of cute chubby sheep spread over the hill to relieve our tiredness. Seeing Wanaka from above was very different than walking in it: it was like gazing at a bright-colored oil painting of Heaven, pure beauty ...
