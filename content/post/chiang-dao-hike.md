Four years ago, led by a local tour guide, Kevy summited Doi Chiang Dao with other 2 hikers. He always recalled the serene sunrise and sunset at the top of it, so ever since we set foot on the Land of Smiles again, he mentioned more than one occasion that we should do it again. Our original plan was to do it overnight, but the price quoted by the tour company we contacted (6800 baht) was way over our budget. So we started to do some online research to see if it is possible to make it a day-hike without a guide, which turned out to be a wiser choice: we encountered at least a hundred local tourists on our way and the campsite on top of the mountain was full of tents, people and music like a party venue. It is no longer that quiet, secluded Doi Chiang Dao. Sections of the trail were very slushy and slippy due to leftover rain and dew, which could be unsafe to hike with heavy backpacks and gear. It is common for local tourists who just want to spend a chill-out weekend on Doi Chiang Dao to hire porters or guides to help carry their camping stuff to the mountain top. Even without getting to watch the sunrise or sunset, we were pround of finishing the 15km work-out as planned and did enjoy the green panoramas at the summit. That night we rewarded ourselves with a huge nice Thai meal ...
