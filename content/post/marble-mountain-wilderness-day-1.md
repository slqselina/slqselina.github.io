Pines, bushes, creeks and grit, a familiar scenery that reminded us of the backpacking hike we just did a week ago in Trinity Alps.

Same dry weather at noon.

After noticing Campbell Lake was a nice but quite busy camping spot, we changed out mind of spending the night there and planned to try our luck with Cliff Lake.

The way to Cliff Lake doesn't seem long on the map, but it has some steep sections. In contrast to the green, popular Campbell Lake, Cliff Lake seemed bleak and quiet. That night we were pretty much the only ones camping there.
