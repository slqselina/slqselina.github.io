{{< figure src="/img/2017/8/mt-tallac-a.jpg" title="Mt. Tallc is known as one of the most popular trailes in Tahoe region and it was weekend in the busy summer, so we started the hike early in the morning in the hope of avoiding big crowd. To our surprise, we soon encounted a group of young people who were already ready to go back home. They said they started between 4am-ish to catch the sunrise!" >}}
