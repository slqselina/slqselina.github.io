We woke up early to watch the sunrise while having warm breakfast to keep out the cold. Then we took a walk along the bank of the lake and palyed with the unmelted snow from last winter. "Hey, are we really in summer?"

From certain angle Cliff Lake didn't appear as bleak as yesterday late afternoon, probably because of the glare of the morning sun.

When hearing the name "Summit Lake", we automatically depicted in our mind a secluded alpine lake located on topo of one of the lofty mountains and thus were prepared to hike up a lot. However, the trail turned out to be short and mostly level.

Ok, so Summit Lake isn't at the summit. But we still like it. When there is no wind, the lake perfectly reflects the rocky mountains surrounding it like a mirror.

Dark salamanders and small fish were playing hide-and-seek in the lake, blue and red dragonflies perching on the exuberant grass grown at the bank, bluejays poping and chirping briskly in the pinery, while a naughty chipmunk was trying to steal our food laying on the ground and of course we didn't allow it.

"Let's call it a day and just chill out here!" Hiking is not always about how many miles accomplished or how many destinations checked, sometimes slowing down the paces allows us to appreciate more subtle, tiny detailes in the nature which are no less beautiful and inspiring.

We were having a good time snacking, napping, readding books and strolling around at the campsite by the lake. Kevy even jumped into the lake and swimmed for a while. Later, other 2 or 3 lone hiker also came to camp by the lake. We saluted one another and exchanged infomation.

During the chatting this energetic lady Barb from Bay Area who was probably at her 60 or 70 s and doing a PCT section mentioned: “The world is big and wonderful. I'm trying my best to see as much as possible before I'm gone.” That's exactly what we were thinking too!
