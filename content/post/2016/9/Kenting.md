Honestly, my first impression about Kenting was not good at all. It was cloudy when we arrived at Kenting Street yesterday, where our hotel was located. The beaches recently visited by the typhoon looked dirty and the ocean was grayish. Also, we found the local merchants were not as nice and smiley as those in Taipei or Tainan, except the owner of our hotel. It is said that Kenting Street was created merely for developing local tourism, no wonder we felt it lacked sense of history and the restaurants were pricy.

When we were just upset about our decision of coming here, this morning the weather turned out to be a great surprise! It was super sunny outside, we were excited enough to ignore the power cut-off all over Hengchun Peninsula and quickly get ready to tour around on our motorbike.

Our first stop was a reefy beach on our way to Eluanbi Park. The Pacific Ocean appeared a sapphire-like pure blue, totally different from what we saw.

It was a pity that the walking path along the cost within Eluanbi Park was closed for post-typhoon cleaning, but it was still nice to take a walk in this verdant park and visit the historic lighthouse on the Cape Eluanbi as the southernmost end of the island of Taiwan.

Our third stop Longpan Park was an alpine steppe, from which one can enjoy a stunning view by overlooking the meandering Pacific coastline. But it was so windy on top of the mountain that we didn’t want to stay there for long.

Before moving on, we stopped by a austere-looking restaurant in a small village on our way for lunch. The beef noodle cooked by the old lady was very yummy, and yet reasonably priced comparing Kenting Street.

Jialeshui Scenic Garden was really today’s highlight. At the beginning we were just walking on a path built along the coast, accompanied by the deafening sounds from the waves chopping against the reefs on one side and several waterfalls on the other side. After reaching the end of the walking path was where the real adventure began …

We found a pond formed by ocean water trapped among rocks, calm and clear, quite contrary to the chopping waves at its outside edge.  Panda heard the call of the wild and popped into the pool without hesitation.

By the time we left Jialeshui Scenic Garden, the sun had started to set, so we headed to the White Beach, famous for being one of the film sets of the Oscar-awarded movie Life of Pi, expecting peaceful beach sunset. To our disappointment, the isolated virgin beach shown in the movie had gone. It was neither very quiet nor clean. So after taking a nap on the beach, we decided to call it a day and go back to for dinner.
