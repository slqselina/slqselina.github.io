As the typhoon Meranti was on its way, it was stormy in Taipei most time of the day, but we didn’t want to give up sightseeing since our stay in Taiwan would not be long.

After having some hot sweet soybean pudding in one of the busy restaurants in the underground shopping center by Taipei Station as breakfast, first of all we took the subway to get to Longshan Temple, one of the most important historic Buddhist temples in Taipei firstly built by the early immigrants from China’s southeast Fujian Province during the 18th century. The glossy colorful curvy roof ridge was easy to be noticed from far. We often saw this so-called “swallow tail” style ridge when traveling in south Fujian Province, though not always with the same grandiosity. Because of the constant restorations, the temple didn’t seem as old as it was supposed to be. We took a walk through the entire building complex and found that it not enshrined not only Buddha and Bodhisattvas but also a series of Chinese Taoist gods such as Mazu-the sea goddess, Lord Guan-the martial god, Yue Lao-the god of matchmaking, love and marriage, Wenchang Dijun-the god of academy and examines … and even Hua Tuo, a famous physician in China’s history.  The golden hall which housed Guanyin (or “God of Mercy”) was the most impressive to us, especially its brilliant caisson ceiling.

From Longshan Temple to Bopiliao Historic Neighborhood was a short walk, but we didn’t find it attractive…

Then Panda felt hungry, so we started to look for food and end up in front of Ay-Chung Flour-Rice Noodle in the busy Ximending neighborhood recommended by Lonely Planet. We would never miss this tiny restaurant because the waiting line along the corridor was extremely long even though it was raining hard! Such an enthusiasm these gourmets showed! Panda joined them and finally got a small disposable bowl filled with noodle, broth, pork intestines (yes, eating pork or beef intestines is common in Asia…) and a bit of green leave vegetable. He finished it quickly on his feet and concluded that it tasted not bad, but not as amazing as he had expected, probably because his western taste differed from Asian ones.

Because the rain barely subdued, we decided to go to the nearby National Taiwan Museum instead of Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall. The entry of the imposing western-style museum building only cost 30 NT$ and granted one free visit if we wanted to come back, but maybe the timing wasn’t good, we felt a bit disappointed to see only two small-scale exhibitions in this, one about Taiwanese aborigines, the other about the local fauna and flora. After consulting the museum staff, we walked to the Land Bank Exhibition Hall right across the avenue, which was also part of National Taiwan Museum and held exhibitions about natural history.

There are two details that we specially appreciate about the museum. One is the umbrella rack sitting at the entrance of the museum, which allows the audience to temporarily lock their umbrellas on the rack and take the key with them into the building so that the audience doesn’t need to worry about losing their umbrellas and the floors in the interior of the museum can stay dry. The other is the museum staff’s warm and helpful attitude at the moment of answering questions, as if they were our conversable old neighbors. (Afterwards we would find out that this helpful and polite manner seems to be common in Taiwanese service industry.)

After finishing the visit, we walked randomly on the street in the drizzling rain and unintentionally returned to Taipei Station where we started.  Haha, maybe Taipei isn’t as big as we thought!
