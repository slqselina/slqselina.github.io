Chishang -> Fuli -> Dongli -> Yuli

Since we over-tasked ourselves yesterday by riding extra miles from Luye to Chishang, today we decided to slow down a bit by stopping in Yuli, a small town located 30 kms ahead. The free Chinese breakfast buffet provided by the hotel included scrambled eggs, fried gluten balls, stirred col, pickles and rice congee, which might not be pleasant to Panda’s American taste, but still made Penguin quite happy.

Before departing, we toured in the town for a while and visited Chishang Riceball Museum, learning about the important history of the local rice culture and production of riceballs as a staple fast food especially for early rail passengers.

Visitors can also buy bags of raw rice to carry home or try the fresh-cooked riceball bento in the museum. Outside the museum building there was an out-of-use train which was not only good for pictures, but also had been turned into a special dining area for the visitors to sit by the windows and eat their riceball bento. Probably we got there too early in the morning and the museum building was open but without staff moving around or the famous fresh Chishang riceball for sale. Seeing more and more dark clouds were gathering in the sky, we were obliged to hit the road soon.

There are some slopes between Chishang and the next quite town Fuli, but they are not as steep as yesterday’s Mt. Baohua. After taking a break in Fuli and recharged ourselves with ice cream in Seven-Eleven, we started over and carefully went through a highway section.

After reaching the run-down Dongli, there is a 10km-long smooth and level bike trail built on an abandoned railway which goes all the way to Yuli with idyllic countryside scenery.

Based on comments on google map, we found this extremely cheap (only 700 or 800 NTD per night) [Fu Jin Hotel](https://goo.gl/maps/x3GSLDvSpy62) in Yuli. The old lady at the reception was nice enough to let us to tour the guest rooms and pick out whichever one we liked. The building was apparently old, and so was the furniture in the room, but at least it was clean. AC and hot shower were functioning well. With the little money we paid, what else could we possibly complain? It was a deal!
