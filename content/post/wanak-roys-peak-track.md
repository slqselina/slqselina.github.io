We remembered having read somewhere that it took 3 hours to do Roy’s Peak Track and were looking forward to a leisurely hike at the moment of our departure. But once getting to the trail head and looking up at the towering Mt. Roy, we immediately realized we must have gotten it wrong! 3 hour is meant to be for one-way. Along the steep ascending trail was the rewarding breath-taking panorama of the blue lake, the scattered islands in it and the snow-capped mountains around it. So glad that we didn’t forget to bring with us the rustic hand-carved wooden hiking poles we purchased in the middle of Queen Charlotte Track, and flocks of cute chubby sheep spread over the hill also helped relieve our tiredness. Seeing Wanaka from above was very different than walking in it: it was like gazing at a bright-colored oil painting of Heaven, pure beauty ...
