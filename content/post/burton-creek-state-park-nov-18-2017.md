Trip Log:

* 12:48pm - start hiking
* 15:23pm - finish the hike

By the time we arrived at the entrance of Burton Creek State Park it was already noon, so we decided to choose a relatively easier loop following the signs showed on the map: 1-> 15 -> 21-> 19-> 12-> 11 -> 18 -> 8 -> 7 -> 2 -> 1. After passing the Junction 11, we immediately felt the snow on the trail was much thicker. Hiking in the snow is similar to walking on a sandy beach in that to move forward we had to fight harder.

This trail bears no drastic altitude change, so we still calmly took time to play in the snow and eat some food. Next time we want to try one of the trails that leads to a scenic overlook, which should be more challenging.
