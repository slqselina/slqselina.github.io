The Pyramid Creek Loop Trail takes little time, but provides beautiful views of waterfalls. The trailhead is right one the side of Lincoln Hwy to the southwest of South Lake Tahoe, about 20 to 30 minutes away.

Some sections of the trail are easy to be lost, so a trail sign can be turn out to be helpful.

Within 30 minutes, we already reached this big waterfall, impressive.

Turning around with our backs to the big waterfall and looking into the distance, we saw the long Horsetail Falls running from the ridge of the high mountain. Trying to observe it more closely, we decided to march towards Desolation Wilderness.

The trail goes along the creek, accompanied by pines, rocks and bushes.

20 minutes later, we reached the boundary of Desolation Wilderness, not bad.

Where the sign of Desolation Wilderness is more like a clearing, which provides a more open view of the rugged mountians carved by glaciers.

Some samll cascades are nearby.

After enjoying the cascades long enough, we went deeper into Desolation.

Sometimes crossing the streams through the fallen tree trunks requires a good sense of balance.

By the time when we were able to gaze the Horsetail Falls a bit more closely, we realized that we wouldn't have enough time to reach it and come back before it got dark. For safety reason, we decided to make it some other day and start to hike back.
