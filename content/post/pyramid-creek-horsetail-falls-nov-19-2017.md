The lake quickly unfolded in front of us like a scrolling painting. We stop to have breakfast while enjoying the view ... for almost an hour!

This trail involves a lot of scrambling, which turns out to be even more challenging with the constant increase of the altitude. We felt cheered up by these flourishing yellow and purple flowers.

From the top of Mt. Tallac, one can not only see Lake Tahoe, Cascade Lake and Fallen Leaf Lake, but also several other alpine lakes located in the Desolation Wilderness.

Chipmunks on the summit are not shy at all. They seem to have a good life on the chilly mountain top.

By the time we start walking back, legions of people were ascending  even though the sun was hiding and it was starting to rain.

The return trip was much easier, but we felt reluctant to say goodbye to this lake view. We'll be back soon ...
