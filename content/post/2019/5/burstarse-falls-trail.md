Reluctant to leave our fur kid behind, we chose the dog-friendly Burstarse Falls Trail instead of Castle Crag State Park.

Actually the trail goes right next to the State Park and at some point during the hike from certain angle we were able to peek a bit of the so-called Castle Crag, but we didn´t feel pity at all.

The trail is mostly even, except the first one mile and the rugged path towards the top fall. Apparently it is also very kid-friendly. We met several groups of people hiking with small kids.

We took a long break and had lunch at the small lower fall, where Bowie jumped into the pool to cool himself down and swam for fun.

From there, the trail started to become difficult, but the middle fall didn’t disappoint us at all, which almost made us think it was the end of the trail.

The trail which connects the middle fall to the top fall was partly overgrown and hard to find, but all the efforts were proved to be worth it once we arrived at the bottom of the top fall and by lifting our head were able to gaze at that brightly white water constantly dropping from a high rock. It was like witnessing a goddess gracefully descending from the blue sky, all beautiful and mesmerizing. Even though we had seen many waterfalls before, this one still somehow touched our soul as if it had some kind of powerful spirit. While I was satisfied enjoying the waterfall from far, Panda took a risk climbing the slippery wet rock to reach its foot and surprisingly didn't find a pool there...
