It look us 2 hours and 20 minuets to drive down to Mono Lake From South Lake Tahoe, California. While enjoying the snow-capped landscapes of Sierra Nevada, we also seized the chance to top the tank in the State of Nevada, where gas is much cheaper. It was sunny all the way until we were approaching Lee Vining, the nearest town to Mono Lake. It seemed like a lot of vapor was trapped in the valley forming thick clouds over the lake.
