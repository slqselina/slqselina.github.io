Hawaiiloa Ridge trail is probably Penguin's favorite among all the hikes we've done together in Hawaii, not only because the mountain-and-ocean views along the trail are breathtaking but also because we encountered a mostly bright sunny day, which turned out to be very precious during our stay in Hawaii. It is 3.5 ~ 4 miles, out-and back. What is special about this trail is that the trailhead is located in a very nice and gated neighborhood which only allows certain amount of cars with Hawaii Driver's License  (fortunately we do have it) to register and get in for hiking activities. So, if you are not a Hawaii resident and don't want to miss this scenery trail, you will have to do it with at least one local friend. The good side of it is that the hikers can always enjoy the nature in peace and quiet, avoiding the busy crowds which are often seen in Hawaii's most touristy spots.
