      <description>Dec 1, 2015 Ship Cove-&amp;gt;Camp Bay Campsite 27 km - Overcast/Rainy  We took a ferry from the pier in Picton to the starting point of this hike at Ship Cove. During the ride we not only witnessed the green rolling mountains along Queen Charlotte Sound but also cute little penguins living on an isolated islands and groups of welcoming dolphins popping out of the water.           The trail was muddy from the rain with continuous ups and downs and some bridge crossings but we were rewarded with stunningly beautiful views of the sound every once a while.</description>
